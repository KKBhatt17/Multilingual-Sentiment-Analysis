# Multilingual-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project I have developed a multilingual sentiment analysis system. This system can be used for sentiment classification task over 3 languages namely English, Hindi and Marathi.

Input: Any sentence in English or Hindi or Marathi.

Output: Sentiment Class (Positive or Negative or Neutral).

I have also provided a very easy to use GUI to use this system which is basically as web interface.

At the back of the system there are two models distilbert and mbert. Usert can select any of these two for the classification task.
